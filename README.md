clojurePOSIX
=========

Investigating making a lisp to be used for unix scripting. Probably destined to join the ranks of abandoned lisps.

The aims for this project are:
  * Get to know the internals of Clojure in more depth
  * Build a Clojure interpreter that is quick enough when starting to be able to be used for scripting tasks
  * Ensure good two-way communication with POSIX/UNIX/LINUX OS for scripting
  
This project is NOT suitable for production and quite likely never will be, but I'm having fun writing it so far...
